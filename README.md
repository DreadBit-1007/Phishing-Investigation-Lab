# Phishing-Investigation-Lab
The Phishing Email Analysis & Incident Investigation project is a practical cybersecurity simulation that demonstrates how suspected phishing emails are analyzed using forensic techniques, threat intelligence tools, and structured SOC investigation methods to identify malicious indicators and determine risk.

## 🔎 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world SOC analyst investigation of a suspected phishing email. The goal is to analyze a suspicious message using industry-standard techniques to determine whether it is malicious, benign, or suspicious, while documenting the full investigation process like a professional incident responder.

The project involves examining email headers, sender infrastructure, URLs, attachments, and threat intelligence sources to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and signs of spoofing or social engineering. It demonstrates practical skills in email forensics, OSINT investigation, threat correlation, and incident reporting.

By completing this project, you showcase your ability to follow a structured security investigation workflow, produce a professional SOC-style incident report, and make evidence-based security decisions — all of which are core responsibilities of entry-level cybersecurity analysts.
